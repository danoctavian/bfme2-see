<h1>Online Connectivity and Performance Troubleshooting</h1>

<p>Online gaming is a fairly involved process. &nbsp;Several 
 factors can contribute or take away from, a fun online experience. &nbsp;When 
 troubleshooting online performance you have to keep in mind that you are 
 not only dealing with your computer, but also the computer you are connecting 
 to. &nbsp;Every 
 computer your signal passes through can also affect the speed and overall 
 quality of an online game.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Information transfer on the Internet is handled by shuttling bits of 
 information, known as packets. For example, when you visited a web page 
 all the parts of the page are passed to your modem in packets. Playing 
 online games, is simply a matter of passing packets back and forth between 
 your computer and a server.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>One issue possibly affecting high-speed connections to our online games 
 is one of <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>packets</B></span>. Many high-speed 
 modems have no minimum specified packet size for outbound packets. When 
 given a smaller packet, a correctly configured router will pad the packet 
 to an acceptable size, and then will pass the information along. In the 
 case of the older Internet router code, these packets may not be padded 
 and can be discarded or corrupted before continuing along to the game 
 server. The information passed through your modem to our servers may be 
 corrupted or discarded - resulting in lost information, disconnects, lag, 
 and other problems.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To check into this packet loss you can run a trace route program to 
 see if there is any major loss on the way. &nbsp;We 
 use a trace program that was originally made for one of our games. &nbsp;This 
 program can be used for any online trace.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul type="disc" class="whs1">
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Run UO Trace to determine routing factors. &nbsp;</p></li>
</ul>

<p class="whs2"><a href="../Whitepages/UO_Trace.htm"><img src="../Red_Page.gif" x-maintain-ratio="TRUE" width="18px" height="16px" border="0" class="img_whs3"> Click here for instructions on using UO Trace.</a></p>

<ul type="disc" class="whs1">
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Another issue is the speed with which your system 
 processes the data and sends it our again. &nbsp;If 
 your system meets the minimum requirements for the game make sure the 
 system also meets the requirements for playing on the internet. &nbsp;These 
 extra requirements can include: </p></li>
	
	<ul type="disc" class="whs1">
		
		<li class=kadov-p><p>Proper connection speed.</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p><p>Higher memory requirements.</p></li>
	</ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>If your system has any virus scanning or internet 
 security software running these to, can slow down your signal. &nbsp;These 
 programs check every packet that goes in or out of the system. &nbsp;Make 
 sure that all non-essential programs are turned off before starting the 
 game.</p></li>
</ul>

<p class="whs2"><a href="../Whitepages/Ending_Background_Tasks.htm"

<ul type="disc" class="whs1">
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Along with background tasks make sure the system 
 is running at top performance. &nbsp;Make 
 sure all of the drivers are up to date. &nbsp;If 
 the drivers are up to date then it reduces the chance of system hang ups 
 which could create lag.</p></li>
</ul>

<ul type="disc" class="whs1">
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>In-game details and options can impact packet 
 size and speed. &nbsp;The 
 more details you have turned on, the more information the game has to 
 process. &nbsp;If 
 you have any filters for text, these can also slow down the game. &nbsp;Try 
 lowering options to speed up game play. &nbsp;Here 
 is a small example list of things that could slow down online games.</p></li>
	
	<ul type="disc" class="whs1">
		
		<li class=kadov-p><p>Translation filters for incoming text.</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p><p>Error logging.</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p><p>Obscenity filters.</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p><p>High end lighting effects.</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p><p>High graphic details.</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p><p>In-game viewing distance. </p></li>
	</ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Although this is not as big of a problem now as 
 it was in the past, some older Internet routers can slow down due to online 
 traffic. &nbsp;This 
 most often occurs during peak traffic times. &nbsp;From 
 3 PM PST (GMT 8 PM) to 10 PM PST (GMT 6 AM).</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Make sure that you have all the required ports 
 open so that the game can successfully send and receive information, thus 
 improving your online experience. &nbsp;The 
 full port information can be found in your manual.</p></li>

<ul type="disc" class="whs1">
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Be sure that your connection meets the speed requirements 
 for the game. &nbsp;The 
 minimum internet connection speed is listed with the minimum requirements
