<h1>UO Trace</h1>

<p><em>UO Trace</em> 
 &nbsp;will allow you to find out exactly where any problems in your Internet 
 connection may be occurring. If you are online, <a href="ftp://ftp.ea.com/pub/ez/support_files/uotrace.exe"
													target=_blank>click 
 here</a> to get the program. Click once on the link, and save it to your 
 computer's desktop.&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p>Double-click on the <strong><em>uotrace.exe</em></strong> 
 to run it. </li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p>You will be asked if you wish to download the server 
 list. Answer <strong>No</strong> to the question. (this option is no longer 
 available) </li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p>Click on the <strong>Options</strong> menu then select 
 <strong>Advanced</strong>. </li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p>Enter in the name of the server you are trying to 
 connect to. This can either be an IP 
 address or a web address without the www (ea.com 
 for example) </li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p>Click on the <strong>Trace Route</strong> button. 
 A succession of host names will begin to appear in the main window. These 
 are the computers your data passes through on its way to the <em>UO</em> 
 Server. Once the function is complete, a message that says <strong><em>Traceroute 
 successful</em></strong> will appear in the lower left corner of the window. 
 </li>
	
	<ul>
		
		<li class=kadov-p
			class=kadov-p>If you get a message saying <strong><em>Maximum 
 number of hops exceeded</em></strong> : </li>
		
		<ul>
			
			<li class=kadov-p
				class=kadov-p>Click on <strong>Options</strong></li>
			
			<li class=kadov-p
				class=kadov-p>Then click on <strong>Settings</strong></li>
			
			<li class=kadov-p
				class=kadov-p>Change the max hops to a higher number and 
 re-trace. </li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p>To the left of each host name there is a shield icon. 
 These should be green, indicating no problems. </li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p>Select the <strong>Poll</strong> button.&nbsp; This 
 tells the program to send packets of data through the route to the final 
 host. As the data is being sent, look at the &quot;pkts 
 r/s&quot; column. 
 Let it send about <strong>40</strong> packets then select <strong>Stop 
 Poll</strong>. </li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>How to interpret the results:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p><strong style="font-weight: bold;"><em style="font-style: italic;">Host 
 names/servers</em></strong> &nbsp;- These are the individual computers 
 that make up the Internet. The connection you make to the server may travel 
 through 15-25 individual hosts before reaching it. Problems suffered by 
 these hosts can cause poor game performance. The shield icons next to 
 the host names give a graphical display of quality.&nbsp; Green indicating 
 a good connection and as it worsens, the colors pass through various shades 
 of yellow, red, gray, and finally, black. </li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p><strong style="font-weight: bold;"><em style="font-style: italic;">Ping 
 Average</em></strong> &nbsp;&amp;ndash; 
 Most games use the <strong>TCP/IP</strong> protocol that sends data in 
 the form of packets. A ping time is the amount of time it takes for a 
 packet of data to be sent from your computer to a host server. </li>
	
	<ul>
		
		<li class=kadov-p
			class=kadov-p>If you are getting pings that are higher than 
 <strong>200ms</strong> then you will notice a bit of latency in the game. 
 </li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p
			class=kadov-p>If the ping for a particular host is too high 
 (<strong>above 225ms</strong>) it usually signifies that the host you 
 are testing is either receiving more traffic than it can effectively handle, 
 or is having some type of technical issue. </li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A high ping will cause your client to not be able to communicate fast 
 enough with the server for the game to maintain fluid motion. This will 
 result in your game's movements appearing jerky and you will notice that 
 the players around you seem to be able to move much faster than you can. 
 This is due to the fact that the other players are most likely taking 
 a different route to the server and are not being affected by the problem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you consistently notice high ping times, contact your ISP and discuss 
 the problem with them. Be sure to have a list of the problem hosts or 
 to actually be running <strong><em>UOtrace</em></strong> while you are 
 speaking with them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There will be some routers that your data will pass through that are 
 independent companies and your ISP may not have any influence over them. 
 In this case you can use the nifty <strong><em>Who is?</em></strong>&nbsp;feature 
 of <strong><em>UOtrace.</em></strong></p>

<ol>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p>Simply right-click on a host name </li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p>Select <strong>Who is?</strong></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p>You will be given information about that hop, usually 
 including an email address and telephone numbers which you can use to 
 contact them yourself. </li>
</ol>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p><strong style="font-weight: bold;"><em style="font-style: italic;">% 
 Loss</em></strong> &nbsp;- This is the percentage of packets that are 
 being lost. In other words, you are sending information to or through 
 that host and the host is either not receiving the data or is not able 
 to return it to you. Any packet loss is a sign of some type of problem. 
 These problems could be caused by hardware issues at the host server, 
 bottlenecking (too many users communicating through that host), telephone 
 line noise, and other causes. </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most packet loss issues are generally resolved quickly by the hosts 
 (a matter of minutes), although some may take several days to resolve. 
 If you consistently notice packet loss, you should contact your provider 
 to discuss possible solutions. You may also consider trying a different 
 ISP.</p>
