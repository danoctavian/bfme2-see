==================================================================
Known Issues
==================================================================

There is a known issue with recent ATI Catalyst drivers, including 
versions 6.9 and 6.10. If you have these drivers, you may experience 
frequent crashes in game. This issue has been found with several ATI 
video cards, including the Radeon X1800, Radeon X800 XT, Radeon 9800 
Pro and Radeon 9600. ATI has addressed this problem in the Catalyst 
6.11 drivers and all subsequent versions of these drivers.

On some video cards that are running dual-monitor setups, you may
encounter visual distortions on the screen. If you encounter this
issue, go to the game's "Main Menu" and click on "Options". Choose 
a different resolution under "Display Options" and then click on 
"Accept Changes". This should correct the problem. If you choose, 
you can switch back to your original resolution.

You will experience problems running the game with a monitor set to 
"portrait mode". That is, if your monitor is set to display content 
vertically instead of in the traditional 4:3 aspect ratio. The Lord 
of the Rings, The Rise of the Witch-king only supports monitors running 
in 4:3 mode.

Users with a Sony DDU-1612 or DVD-ROM drive might experience 
issues with reading The Lord of the Rings, The Rise of the Witch-king 
DVD media. Users with these drives can upgrade to the latest firmware 
to resolve these issues, though we do not recommend it. IMPORTANT: 
You should always consult with your component's hardware manufacturer 
before attempting to flash its firmware. 

There is a known driver issue for the NVIDIA GeForce FX 5000 family 
of video cards using version 81.98 or older drivers that result in 
broken textures on some of the game's structures. This issue has been 
resolved by NVIDIA. Please make sure you have the latest drivers.

There is a known issue on ATI X1300, X1600, and X1800 video cards 
running Catalyst 6.1 or older video drivers that result with some 
shadows disappearing and reappearing when the in-game camera is rotated. 
ATI is aware of this problem, and it has been addressed in more recent 
versions of the Catalyst drivers.

There is another known issue with ATI video cards. There is a known 
crash when users attempt to Alt-Tab out of the game (during a load 
screen, for example) and then Alt-Tab back in. ATI is aware of this 
problem, and it has been addressed in more recent versions of the 
Catalyst drivers.

You may encounter audio problems with some Creative Labs Audigy 
sound cards if you select the EAX3 option in the Options menu. 
Make sure you update your Audigy with the latest drivers.

If you choose to select the EAX3 option, make sure that you have 
the proper speaker type selected in Windows. To do so, do the 
following:

  1) In Windows, click on "Start".
  2) Choose "Control Panel".
  3) Choose "Sound, Speech, and Audio Devices".
  4) Click on "Adjust System Volume".
  5) Under "Speaker settings" click on "Advanced...".
  6) Select the "Speakers".
  7) From the "Speaker setup:" pull down menu, choose your applicable 
     speaker setup.
  8) Click on "Apply" and then "OK".

If you have your screensaver enabled and it is activated while the 
game is loading any mission, the game will be minimized to your Windows 
taskbar, which is typically located at the bottom of your Windows 
desktop. If this happens, deactivate the screensaver and maximize the 
game by clicking on the "The Lord of the Rings, The Rise of the Witch-king" 
button on the taskbar. 

You cannot listen to certain sounds in the game's WorldBuilder if "High 
Quality Audio" is set to "OFF". If “High Quality Audio” is turned "OFF" in 
the game’s options, the various “Listen” buttons in WorldBuilder will 
not work with certain sounds with names like “Ambient<XXXX>Stream”. Also, 
“Listen to map” will not play those sounds. To listen to these sounds, 
you must run the game, click on "Options" and then "Settings" from 
the main menu, and click on the "High Quality Audio" checkbox.

Please note that Windows XP with Service Pack 1 might cause problems 
with DirectX installation. 

There is a known issue with NVIDIA GeForce PCX 5900 128MB PCI-E cards.
Users with this card may experience occassional graphics glitches in the 
form of black lines scrolling across the screen.

If your computer is rebooted during an installation or there is a power 
outage during installation, the game will not install correctly. This will 
cause the Autorun program to crash when a re-install is attempted. To fix this, 
you will need to manually delete the game folder named "The Lord of the Rings, 
The Rise of the Witch-king". This folder can be found in the default location 
(C:) Program Files > Electronic Arts or in whichever folder you chose to install
the game.

NAT/Firewall
==================================================================

If you are playing The Lord of the Rings, The Rise of the Witch-king 
behind a USRobotics router, you will need to upgrade its firmware 
to the latest version, v2.7 or later. See the USRobotics support 
Web site for details on how to do so.

If you are playing the game behind a D-Link router, you must check the 
"Send Delay" box in the Online Options menu for The Lord of the Rings 
The Rise of the Witch-king. To get here from the Main Menu, click on the 
Multiplayer button, click the Online button, login as you regularly 
would, and then click on Options after you have successfully logged on.

irresolvable issues. If you frequently experience connection problems,
you may want to use the port forwarding feature.

behind a software firewall, you will need to add the game's executable

path to the game's executable. This file is typically located in "C:\Program Files\
Electronic Arts\The Lord of the Rings, The Rise of the Witch-king\lotrbfme2ep1.exe". You

Forwarding/Port Triggering features to play the game behind your firewall.

difficulties you can likely use Port Forwarding/Port Triggering to ensure
improved reliability.
