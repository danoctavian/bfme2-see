; Commandset.INI for S.E.E....
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// See what was for Generals below.  For LotR things have changed since we no longer have the same UI. 
// If the Command in CommandButton.ini has a field Radial=Yes, then that command will show up in a radial menu 
// above the object in the game world. If a command button has InPalantir=Yes then it will be displayed in the
// palantir when it's in a command set for the selected object. Locations for the Skill button in clockwise fashion.  
// The top right button being button 1. If these actions are not taken, the commands will only show up if you pass in 
// -OldGui to the game (but they are not usable right now).
//
// Command sets are groups of command buttons that will be displayed in the context sensitive user interface 
// for a selected object showing what you can do with that object. LHS numbers are the physical GUI buttons.  
// You can assign a command to any of the physical buttons, they do *NOT* need to appear in continuous order ... 
// so you may have gaps if you desire. RHS strings are CommandButton.ini command names.
//Buttons for a regular command context are ordered as:
//                    +--+
//+--+--+--+--+--+--+ |13|
//|01|03|05|07|09|11| +--+
//+--+--+--+--+--+--+ |14|    <-- Smaller buttons 3 fit within 11 & 12 in height.
//|02|04|06|08|10|12| +--+
//+--+--+--+--+--+--+ |15|
//                    +--+
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Many things just want these three buttons.
